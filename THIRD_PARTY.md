# Third-Party Attributions

trellis2.cpp is MIT (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). This file lists every
external component the project copies, links, or reproduces, and under
which terms.

Three categories, kept apart on purpose:

1. **Vendored source** — foreign code physically present in this
   repository under `third_party/`.
2. **External build dependencies** — resolved at configure time (vcpkg
   or distro package), never copied into the repository.
3. **Reproduced behaviour** — no foreign source was adopted; only the
   observable behaviour, data layout, or numerical result was
   reimplemented under our own design, per the license rules in
   [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

---

## 1. Vendored source (`third_party/`)

All of these are MIT or public domain and are compiled into
`libtrellis2` unconditionally. Each upstream license notice travels
inside the vendored file itself; the files are never reformatted
(`format_code.sh` excludes `third_party/`).

### xatlas

- **Project:** <https://github.com/jpcy/xatlas>
- **License:** MIT License, Copyright (c) 2018-2020 Jonathan Young
- **Vendored:** `third_party/xatlas/xatlas.{h,cpp}` — complete, unmodified.
- **Used by:** `mesh_export.cpp` — UV unwrap for the projected/print
  bake, and the opt-in ordinary atlas path behind `T2GLB_XATLAS`.
- **Notice:** MIT text at the top of `xatlas.h`.

### meshoptimizer

- **Project:** <https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer>
- **License:** MIT License, Copyright (c) 2016-2026 Arseny Kapoulkine
- **Version:** 1.2 (`MESHOPTIMIZER_VERSION 1020`)
- **Vendored:** a **subset**, not the whole library —
  `meshoptimizer.h`, `allocator.cpp`, `indexgenerator.cpp`,
  `simplifier.cpp`, `tangentspace.cpp`, `vfetchoptimizer.cpp`. All taken
  unmodified from the `v1.2` tag (the header is bit-identical to upstream
  apart from CRLF line endings, which the whole vendored tree uses).
- **Used by:** `quad_remesh.cpp` — `meshopt_simplify` bounds the input size
  handed to the quad remesher. Note that these files sat in the tree unused and
  uncompiled until then; they were added to a build target for the first time
  with the quad stage. `mesh_export.cpp` —
  `meshopt_generateTangents` (`tangentspace.cpp`) builds the
  MikkTSpace-compatible tangent basis the normal map bake is baked
  against, and `meshopt_generateVertexRemapMulti` splits the atlas mesh
  where per-corner tangents disagree. `tangentspace.cpp` needs no
  translation unit beyond `allocator.cpp`, which was already vendored.
- **Notice:** MIT text at the end of `meshoptimizer.h`.

### tinybvh

- **Project:** <https://github.com/jbikker/tinybvh>
- **License:** MIT License, Copyright (c) 2024 Jacco Bikker
- **Version:** 1.7.1
- **Vendored:** `third_party/tinybvh/tiny_bvh.h` — unmodified. None of the
  demos, `tiny_ocl.h`, `testdata/`, or the OpenCL kernels were imported.
  `tiny_bvh_impl.cpp` is ours: it defines `TINYBVH_IMPLEMENTATION` in exactly
  one translation unit.
- **Used by:** `print_remesh.cpp` — the BVH behind the closest-surface PBR
  projection, which is why that path no longer needs CGAL.
- **Note:** tinybvh has no nearest-primitive query, only ray traversal, so we
  use it as the *builder* and traverse its nodes ourselves. That couples us to
  its public `bvhNode`/`primIdx` layout — see `third_party/tinybvh/VERSION.md`
  before bumping the version.
- **Notice:** `third_party/tinybvh/LICENSE`.

### AutoRemesher

- **Project:** <https://github.com/huxingyi/autoremesher> — Dust3D Project /
  Jeremy HU
- **License:** MIT License — the 1.0.0 release relicensed from GPLv3.
- **Version:** 1.0.0 (`autoremesher.pro` VERSION 1.0.0.9), imported 2026-08-11.
  The upstream commit is **not yet pinned**: it came from a local source drop
  rather than a clone. See `third_party/autoremesher/VERSION.md`.
- **Vendored:** a **subset** — upstream `src/AutoRemesher/`,
  `include/AutoRemesher/`, and `thirdparty/isotropicremesher/`, 528 KB. The Qt
  application, shaders, resources, and the bundled Eigen/TBB/QtAwesome copies
  were **not** imported. The upstream directory layout is preserved because the
  umbrella headers reach the implementation through relative paths.
- **Ours, not upstream:** `t2_tbb_shim.h` (TBB's four used entry points over
  `std::thread`), `compat/tbb/*.h` (the header names the sources include), and
  `t2_ar_log.{h,cpp}`.
- **Used by:** `quad_remesh.cpp` — the quad-dominant mid-poly export path.
- **Modifications:** only the mechanical redirect of 35 unconditional
  `std::cerr` writes to `T2_AR_LOG`, recorded as a replayable `sed` in
  `third_party/autoremesher/PATCHES.md`. **The sources carry no TBB patch** —
  removing TBB is done entirely by the shim and the compat headers.
- **Notice:** `third_party/autoremesher/LICENSE`.

### isotropicremesher

- **Project:** bundled in AutoRemesher as `thirdparty/isotropicremesher` —
  Jeremy HU
- **License:** MIT License
- **Vendored:** `third_party/autoremesher/isotropicremesher/`, 11 files,
  imported unmodified with the core above.
- **Used by:** the AutoRemesher core, which requires it; nothing in this
  project calls it directly.
- **Notice:** covered by `third_party/autoremesher/LICENSE`.

### stb

- **Project:** <https://github.com/nothings/stb> — Sean Barrett
- **License:** dual-licensed, public domain (Unlicense) **or** MIT
- **Vendored:** `stb_image.h` (v2.30), `stb_image_write.h` (v1.16).
- **Used by:** image decode on the untrusted upload path
  (`trellis2_preprocess_rgba`, the fuzz targets) and debug image dumps.
- **Notice:** license block at the end of each header.

## 2. Submodule

### ggml

- **Project:** <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml>, tracked through the
  fork <https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/ggml>
- **License:** MIT License, Copyright (c) 2023-2024 The ggml authors
- **Integration:** Git submodule at `ggml/`, built via
  `add_subdirectory(ggml)`. Never reformatted. A submodule pointer
  update is a deliberate, separately reviewed decision — see
  [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
- **Alternative:** `-DTRELLIS2_USE_EXTERNAL_GGML=ON` consumes a system
  ggml through `find_package` instead.

---

## 3. External build dependencies

Not present in this repository. Resolved at configure time — on Windows
through vcpkg (`-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`,
as in `cmake-ninja-win64-rocm-cgal.bat`), on Linux through distro
packages or the containers in `docker/`.

CGAL is kept out of a default configure on purpose: it is a *feature*
of the vcpkg manifest, pulled in only by
`-DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=cgal`, so the copyleft dependency below
cannot be resolved by accident.

### CGAL — optional, **copyleft**

- **Project:** <https://www.cgal.org/>
- **License:** CGAL is split-licensed. The **3D Alpha Wrapping**
  package used here is **GPL-3.0-or-later**, or available under a
  commercial CGAL license.
- **Used by:** `print_remesh.cpp` — `alpha_wrap()` only. The closest-surface
  `project_pbr()` moved to tinybvh; CGAL remains available there as the
  reference backend both are compared against.
- **Encapsulation:** strictly behind `TRELLIS2_CGAL` /
  `TRELLIS2_USE_CGAL=1`. No CGAL header or type appears in
  `trellis2.h`, `trellis2_capi.h`, `mesh_export.h`, or in
  unconditionally compiled code. A build without CGAL retains no CGAL
  dependency and reports the feature as unavailable at runtime.
- **Consequence:** binaries built with `TRELLIS2_CGAL=ON` **and** CGAL
  detected are subject to GPL-3.0-or-later. Default builds are not.

### Transitive dependencies of the CGAL path

Pulled in by the vcpkg `cgal` port, therefore only present in a CGAL
build:

- **Boost** — Boost Software License 1.0 (permissive).
- **GMP** — dual LGPL-3.0-or-later / GPL-2.0-or-later.
- **MPFR** — LGPL-3.0-or-later.

The LGPL components are consumed as unmodified shared libraries.

### Eigen — optional

- **Project:** <https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen>
- **License:** **MPL-2.0** (some bundled files under BSD or other
  MPL2-compatible terms; see `COPYING.README` upstream). Confirmed by
  vcpkg, which reports `MPL-2.0` for the `eigen3` port.
- **Version:** 5.0.1 — the version upstream AutoRemesher bundles and
  what `vcpkg install eigen3` resolves to. The CMake floor is the whole
  5.x line, which excludes the 3.4.0 shipped by Debian/Ubuntu.
- **Used by:** the vendored AutoRemesher core's sparse solvers, and therefore
  required by `TRELLIS2_AUTOREMESHER`. Absent Eigen 5.x the option
  self-disables at configure time and the quad stage reports itself
  unavailable at runtime.
- **Deliberately not vendored.** Declared in the project's `vcpkg.json`
  manifest and consumed through
  `find_package(Eigen3 5.0...<6 CONFIG)` → `Eigen3::Eigen`, so no MPL2
  file enters this MIT repository. A version *range* is required:
  Eigen's `Eigen3ConfigVersion.cmake` treats a single requested version
  as an exact component match, so `find_package(Eigen3 5.0)` would
  reject a later 5.1.
- **Obligation:** Eigen is used unmodified. MPL-2.0 is file-level
  copyleft and explicitly permits combination with a differently
  licensed Larger Work (§3.3); the remaining duty is to retain this
  notice and keep the source obtainable, which the project URL above
  discharges.

## 4. Reproduced behaviour — no source adopted

Everything in this section was built by reproducing behaviour, tensor
layouts, hyperparameters and numerical results; no foreign source text is
present. That describes how these components *were* made. It is a
licence requirement only for copyleft upstreams — for a permissively
licensed reference, [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) allows direct derivation
with attribution, and such a component would be listed under §1 with its
notice rather than here.

### TRELLIS.2 reference pipeline

- **License:** MIT License, Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation
  (`docs/ref/TRELLIS-2/LICENSE`, and identically in the ROCm fork).
- **Relationship:** trellis2.cpp is a from-scratch C++/ggml
  implementation. Stage structure, tensor layouts, hyperparameters and
  numerical results are reproduced so that the taps in
  [`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](docs/VERIFICATION.md) match the PyTorch
  reference, and **no reference source is adopted**. Note that this is
  independence by construction, not by obligation: MIT would have
  permitted translating the reference directly, with its notice carried
  along.
- **Weights** are separate artefacts with their own terms; see the
  model links and license notes in [`README.md`](README.md). The DINOv3
  weights in particular are under the DINOv3 License, not MIT.

### Pillow — Lanczos resampling

- **Project:** <https://python-pillow.org/>
- **Relationship:** `trellis2_preprocess_rgba()` reproduces PIL's
  Lanczos-512 resampling **byte-exactly**, as an independent
  implementation of the documented filter and its coefficient
  generation. No Pillow source is present in this repository.

## Planned additions

Proposed components are listed here and **not yet imported**. They become
real entries above only once the corresponding phase is implemented and
reviewed.

### NAF — feature upsampler, proposed by `docs/plan/pixal3d-proj-conditioning.md`

- **Project:** <https://github.com/valeoai/NAF>
- **License:** Apache License 2.0 (`docs/ref/NAF/LICENSE`). The repository ships
  **no `NOTICE` file**, so §4(d) imposes no notice-propagation duty; retaining
  the licence text and attributing the source discharges it.
- **One file differs:** `src/layers/rope.py` carries its own header — Copyright
  (c) Meta Platforms, under the **DINOv3 License Agreement** — and is the only
  file under `src/` or `utils/` with a copyright header at all. Valeo's
  Apache-2.0 does not relicense Meta's code, so that file is not adopted or
  translated; this port's existing DINOv3 RoPE is the source for the same
  mathematics, which is what the plan specified anyway. Noted so a later
  file-by-file transcription knows the one file to skip.
- **Weights:** `models/NAF/naf_release.pth`, 2,664,431 B, from the project's own
  releases. Not redistributed by this repository.
- **Status:** reference only, under `docs/ref/NAF/`. Nothing imported.

AutoRemesher, isotropicremesher and Eigen were the previous entries here and
moved into §1 and §3 with
[`docs/plan/autoremesher-quad-remesh.md`](docs/plan/autoremesher-quad-remesh.md)
Phase 5.
